I'm going to test if this blog can help me to write some posts in order to force me to remind some concepts that I'm learning. We'll see if it's effective for me!

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub. -->
